## Have you volunteered for a non profit organization in the past? If yes, describe.
## a)Nature of volunteering
 ## b)take -aways from that experience

Yes, I have volunteered for such organizations in the past. That organization provided educational support to underprivileged students. I primarily took mathematics classes for primary students
One of the major takeaways from the experience was to realize that there are so many underprivileged students in the country who are smart and if given the opportunity and platform, can be an exceptional change.
Many people want to achieve something in life but are not able to achieve it due to lack of resources. By participating in force for good, whatever application we will be creating might provide that platform and bridge the gap for these individuals. Hence this might be one of the biggest turning points in their lives. 




## Have you ever solved a complex problem in the past- what was your approach toward solving it?

Yes, I have solved multiple complex problems in the past but focussing on the one relevant here. I would like to mention about a project that we were trying to do last year. So to elaborate the problem statement goes like we have an elementary-level geometry problem. If we upload the image of the question and the diagram, then we are supposed to extract predicates from the image using computer vision so that we will be able to solve the problem directly using a formal language and derive an answer. 
When we got this problem statement, the approach we chose was as follows:
First, break down the problem statement and understand the expectations of the stakeholders.
Then try to collect all the information that we require like in this case what dataset we will use to train our model, and how to get access to that dataset, etc.
Discuss and take opinions amongst the team members on how to solve the problem and mutually decide which path to use. 
Then we started developing the model, and as a first step, we chose to take a small dataset, run the model & get the numbers. Then we presented our model and results.
Then we got feedback and we worked on the suggested changes. We also cleared the future expectations from the client beforehand.
In this way, we developed asked for feedback, made changes, and developed further and then we followed the same cycle again and again till we reached the expected product. Hence we were able to develop a model, which could extract all the predicates from a given image with a significant accuracy. This project went on for 9 months during our 4th year in College.
