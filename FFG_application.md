## What are the motivations for applying for FFG?

One of the biggest motivations for applying for FFG is Code for good-2021. It was the first social good hackathon we were participating in and an amazing experience.Back then, we created a management system for mentors to track the progress of students at Laali Project, a remarkable NGO. Laali Project focuses on creating awareness and educating youngsters on crucial topics like gender sensitization, social and emotional learning, menstrual health & hygiene, and entrepreneurial skills. This initiative not only helps those in need but also creates a lasting impact by empowering young minds early on.

Developing a product that supports such organizations and directly impacts people's lives, potentially even transforming their futures, is one of the biggest motivation for me to join this program. Also as I grew up I realized that I had more privilege than many people around the globe, so I think if I am getting an opportunity to give back to society and bring a  change then I should contribute towards it. 
Another reason for applying is that I am giving myself a challenge to build something to solve a real-life problem whose impact will be visible firsthand to us.



## What skills are you looking to gain/ enhance from participating in FFG?
I believe Force for Good offers a unique platform to acquire multiple valuable skills. This program is allowing us to collaborate with new people and solve a real-life challenge that will have an impact on many peopleâ€™s personal life.

One can gain  invaluable experience in teamwork and leadership. Since we will be working with many new people, we will learn how to manage our team effectively and how we help others when they are stuck or having doubts. This also give us exposure to our leadership qualities and our ability to work with a team in such a way that we can get the best out of each and every team member.
Also, looking forward on connecting to not only new SEPs but also connecting with senior leaders and learning from their years of experience. 

Furthermore we will learn many new things since we will have direct communication with the client, which will teach us how to take feedback and also it will reflect on the gap between what the client is expecting and what developers are thinking.
Along with all this, we will learn new technologies on the fly, since this is not a 24-hour hackathon, we might have ample time to learn and apply new techs, allowing us to learn and explore new domains.



## Have you volunteered for a non profit organization in the past? If yes, describe.
## a)Nature of volunteering
 ## b)take -aways from that experience

Yes, I have volunteered for such organizations in the past. That organization provided educational support to underprivileged students. I primarily took mathematics classes for primary students
One of the major takeaways from the experience was to realize that there are so many underprivileged students in the country who are smart and if given the opportunity and platform, can be an exceptional change.
Many people want to achieve something in life but are not able to achieve it due to lack of resources. By participating in force for good, whatever application we will be creating might provide that platform and bridge the gap for these individuals. Hence this might be one of the biggest turning points in their lives. 




## Have you ever solved a complex problem in the past- what was your approach toward solving it?

Yes, I have solved multiple complex problems in the past but focussing on the one relevant here. I would like to mention about a project that we were trying to do last year. So to elaborate the problem statement goes like we have an elementary-level geometry problem. If we upload the image of the question and the diagram, then we are supposed to extract predicates from the image using computer vision so that we will be able to solve the problem directly using a formal language and derive an answer. 
When we got this problem statement, the approach we chose was as follows:
First, break down the problem statement and understand the expectations of the stakeholders.
Then try to collect all the information that we require like in this case what dataset we will use to train our model, and how to get access to that dataset, etc.
Discuss and take opinions amongst the team members on how to solve the problem and mutually decide which path to use. 
Then we started developing the model, and as a first step, we chose to take a small dataset, run the model & get the numbers. Then we presented our model and results.
Then we got feedback and we worked on the suggested changes. We also cleared the future expectations from the client beforehand.
In this way, we developed asked for feedback, made changes, and developed further and then we followed the same cycle again and again till we reached the expected product. Hence we were able to develop a model, which could extract all the predicates from a given image with a significant accuracy. This project went on for 9 months during our 4th year in College.
